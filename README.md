# forkify Project

Recipe search application with custom recipe uploads.

This application was the result of a UDEMY course called 'The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!
' presented by Jonas Schmedtmann and completed in March 2024.

The user journey is to find a list of recipes when entering an ingredient into the SEARCH bar at the top of the page.
The recipe title, image, and ingredients will appear in the right hand half of the web page.
The user has the option to then bookmark the recipe using the bookmark icon above the recipe. This will add the recipe to the Bookmarked Recipe list.

The user also has the option of adding their own recipe, following the format suggested in the form text input areas and uploading that recipe.
This uploaded recipe will appear in the Bookmark Recipe List with an additional 'person' icon indicating this was a self-uploaded recipe.

The objective of the application was to showcase tools and coding methods learnt in Javascript during the course.
